//! The `Backend` QObject — the single object QML talks to.
//!
//! This is the Qt-side mirror of the GTK app's `State`: QML calls invokables (e.g.
//! `login`), the Rust side drives the `mxc-proto` core on a tokio runtime, and core
//! `Event`s are marshalled back onto the Qt thread to update QObject properties (which
//! QML bindings observe). The actual core wiring lives in [`crate::core`].
